# Partially-Speaker-Dependent-ASR

This is the repository for a [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1elIt6dzH_BaB6P6Al111XFb4aEofjF5mum0ChfuUeFU/edit) exploring the use of a partially speaker-dependent hybrid model as a means to set a goal for 
novel speaker adaptation techniques. The TIMIT dataset and the Kaldi Toolkit were used to conduct experimentation (Zue et al., 1990; Povey et al., 2011). 

Note that this repository is for documentating the models that were
trained during experimentation, and that replicating this project
would require the deletion of the exp and data directories.
